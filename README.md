JUnit testing of a Contact Service Module.
* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  * The easiest way to ensure your code, program, or software is functional and secure, is to program it as if you have no idea what it will say/mean when you come back to it. This ensures that it is readable by everyone and makes it easier to understand your program. After this has been performed, it is important to make sure that variables that shoudn't be accessed are private and final.
  * Don't allow user input where it shouldn't be. Most vulnerabilities will be because user input wasn't properly tested.
  * Make your error codes discrete. Do not let the person trying to get into your application have any idea if they accomplished something.
  * Automation tools are exceptionally useful for software security. JUnit is used in this repository. It allows the testing of code to make sure that code follows instructions that are given to the automation tool before running the program.
* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  * The first thing that needs to be done for interpreting user needs is the collection of information.
  * It is best to collect as much information as possible. Be as thorough as you can. Make sure that you have all information available. This is what you will be using to ensure that you get the program right for your client.
  * If information has already been collected. Make sure that the information provided is everything that you will need. This is extremely important and can save you, and the client, a lot of money and time.
* How do I approach designing software?
  * Designing software can be stressful if you allow it to be. I find it best to design software as though anyone can use it.
  * Giving your software ease of access is the single most important thing for the users of your software.
  * Give the user the information they need to make your application work.
  * Check all inputs/outputs to make sure they are up to standards.
  * Give yourself some time to relax while you are coding. Programming for too long can make errors easier to make.
  * Make sure to use automation tools if you are being extremely thorough.
